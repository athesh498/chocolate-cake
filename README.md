This Cake an be made very easily because it doesn't require any electric beater or a stand mixer just a wire whisk is fine. In this recipe I am using yogurt as a replacement for eggs and making eggless chocolate cake recipe. I am going to bake it in both Oven and pressure cooker so that everyone can cook with ease. This is a rich soft and a fluffy cake which can be used as a base for many other cakes like layer cake, Black forest cake and can be frosted with butter cream or whipped cream frosting to make it even richer.
