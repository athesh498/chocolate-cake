Step 1) Lets start by preheating the oven at 350 F or 175 C, before preheating the cooker lets make some small arrangements:
Add a layer of salt (approximately 2 cups of salt) - we can reuse the salt for future baking 
Then place a wire stand - to elevate the pan from touching the base .
Finally a perforated plate on the top and cover the cooker.
We need to preheat the cooker for 15 minutes on a medium heat without adding the Cooker weight.




Step 2) In a big mixing bowl, sift in all purpose flour, Cocoa powder, Baking powder, baking powder, salt . then add Sugar and mix well. We can also use a wire sieve for mixing everything together.





Step 3) Now lets add the wet ingredients- Milk, Yogurt, oil and vanilla extract , mix well with a wire whisk without any lumps.
Beat the yogurt nicely before adding and make sure there are not lumps.



Step 4) Divide the batter into 2 halves and transfer it to a baking pan.
This recipe yields two 9 inch pans
